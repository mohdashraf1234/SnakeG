# 🐍 Snake Game

A simple and fun **web-based Snake Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The player controls the snake to eat food appearing randomly on the board — each bite increases the score and the snake’s length.
If the snake hits the wall or itself, the game ends with a **“You are out”** message.

## 🚀 **How to Play**

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the **Arrow Keys** or on-screen **Up, Down, Left, Right** buttons to move.
3. Eat the food to increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself — or the game ends!
5. Check your **High Score** and try to beat it!

## 🧠 **Game Logic (Behind the Scenes)**

* The game board is created using **CSS Grid**.
* The snake’s position updates every few milliseconds using **`setInterval()`**.
* Each time the snake eats food:

  * The length increases.
  * The score increments.
  * New food appears randomly on the board.
* Collision detection checks for:

  * Hitting the walls.
  * Biting its own body.
